 # TODOS

- [ ]  Enable group video and messaging functionality
- [ ]  Implement confirm email, reset password and email sending on friend invitation, *Not a big deal to implement, just a little lazy to implement it*
- [ ]  Store messages in an encrypted form in the database
- [ ]  Enhace the UI. I hate CSS, not that good at it ðŸ¥±ðŸ˜“
